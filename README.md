📌 Title of the Project
Student Enrollment Form Using JsonPowerDB

📝 Description
This project is a Student Enrollment Web Form that connects with a JsonPowerDB database for storing and managing student data.
It allows:

New student entry if Roll-No is not found in the database.

Updating existing student data if Roll-No already exists.

Resetting the form to start a new entry easily.

The form includes the following fields:

Roll No (Primary Key)

Full Name

Class

Birth Date

Address

Enrollment Date

The form interacts with the JsonPowerDB via API calls (PUT, GET, UPDATE) in real-time without any backend code.
